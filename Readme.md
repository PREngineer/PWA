Important considerations about progressive apps:

1. iOS icons cannot be transparent, make sure that there is a background color on it.
   It doesn't matter if the border looks square.  
   The phone will adjust it to look like an icon.
2. On Android, USE transparency because it will not format it as an icon.
3. Hard links <a href=""></a> are not OK in iOS you should use javascript relocation.
